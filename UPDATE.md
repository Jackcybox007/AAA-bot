#**🚀 AXO Market Sentinel — Update Log (24/10/2025)**

##**What’s New**

1. **Request Lock System**
   Each user can now have **only one active request** at a time.
   This prevents spam or overlapping queries and keeps responses clean and fast.
   The lock automatically releases once the bot replies — or after 15 minutes if stuck.

2. **Per-Channel Memory (Conversation Mode)**
   The bot now **remembers the last 5 messages** per channel.
   You can have short ongoing discussions about market data — no need to restate context every time.
   Example:

> `?best RAT @ CI1`
> `?and compare with NC1`
> → The bot will understand both.

##**Notes**

* Request now use `?` as the prefix (e.g., `?best`, `?arb`, `?spread`).
* If the bot doesn’t respond, wait a bit — your request may be locked by an ongoing reply.
